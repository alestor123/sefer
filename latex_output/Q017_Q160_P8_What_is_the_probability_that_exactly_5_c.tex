\textbf{Question 17:} The average of 15 observations is 45. First 8 observations average 41, last 8 average 53. Find the 8th observation.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Step 1:} This involves overlapping groups. The 8th observation appears in both the "first 8" and "last 8" groups.

\item \textbf{Step 2:} Given information:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15 observations, mean = 45
\item First 8 observations, mean = 41
\item Last 8 observations, mean = 53
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Step 3:} Calculate total sums using: Sum = Count Ã— Mean
\begin{align}
\text{Total sum} &= 15 \times 45 = 675 \\
\text{Sum of first 8} &= 8 \times 41 = 328 \\
\text{Sum of last 8} &= 8 \times 53 = 424
\end{align}

\item \textbf{Step 4:} The 8th observation is counted twice:
\begin{align}
\text{Sum of first 8} + \text{Sum of last 8} - \text{8th obs} &= \text{Total sum} \\
328 + 424 - \text{8th obs} &= 675 \\
752 - \text{8th obs} &= 675
\end{align}

\item \textbf{Step 5:} Solve: 8th observation = 752 - 675 = 77
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer:} 77

\textbf{Key Concepts:} Mean calculations, overlapping groups, algebraic manipulation
