Sure, I'll provide a solution for the following problem using Python programming language in combination of statistics methods such as mean (average), median(middle value) etc., along with some basic understanding about probability theory concepts like conditional probabilities or independence among events if any are mentioned within this question text. 

\textbf{Question} : Suppose we have a sample data set containing the ages and weights for three individuals: Alice, Bob & Charlie (Alice's age is around 25 years old with weight about 70kg; Bob’s age approximately 31years old at approx 86 kg. Heavyweight person named Charles who weighing almost as much but slightly heavier than him).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the type of problem (probability, statistics) and what we need to find in this case? Probabilities or Statistics related question is needed here because it involves concepts such as mean(average), median etc. 
    
   \end{enumerate}\newline\begin {center}   
      **Solution:**\\ \\
      1. Identify the type of problem (probability, statistics) and what we need to find in this case? Probabilities or Statistics related question is needed here because it involves concepts such as mean(average), median etc.\\  \newline\begin {enumerate}  
    - Step 2: List given information clearly. We have the ages of Alice (about 30 years old) and Bob's age approximately about 86kg, Charlie who weighing almost same but slightly heavier than him with weight approx around 95 kg.\\ \newline\begin {enumerate}
    - Step 1: Identify problem type. This is a statistics related question because we are dealing with data (ages and weights) which involves concepts such as mean(average), median etc.\\\ \\  
    2-Step : List given information clearly, Alice's age around about 30 years old at weight approx of approximately ~75kg; Bob’s approximate height in cm is roughly equal to the average (~86) and weighing slightly more than him. Charles who we have data on his weights but not ages.\\ \newline\begin {enumerate}
    - Step 4: Show calculations step by-step, calculate mean(average), median for Alice's weight & Bob’s age; then find the difference between their average and each other (conditional probability).\\ \\  3.Step : State final answer clearly with units as per given data set.\\ \newline\begin {enumerate}
    - Step 5: Final Answer, we have calculated that Charles' weight is approximately one-third of Alice’s; Bob has about a quarter part in relation to Charlie and he weighing more than both. \\  4.Key Concepts : List important concepts such as mean (average), median etc if any are mentioned within this question text.\\
\end{enumerate}  \newline\\    **Answer:** Charles' weight is approximately one-third of Alice’s; Bob has about a quarter part in relation to Charlie and he weighing more than both. \\  4.Key Concepts : List important concepts such as mean (average), median etc if any are mentioned within this question text.\\
