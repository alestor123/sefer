Sure, I can help you understand the problem from this image of a question related to probability theory in statistics context but it'll be helpful if someone else provides more details about what exactly is asked or where your student might have misunderstood something due to lack of information provided here. 

Please provide me with additional detail such as:
1) The specific problem statement from the image (e.g., "What are some common types of events in probability theory?"). This will help us understand what we need to find and identify appropriate formulas or methods for solving this particular question type.  2) Any other information about how you want me to format my response, such as whether I should include all the steps with detailed calculations (if possible), explanations on important concepts etc., in LaTeX syntax?
