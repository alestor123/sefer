Sure, I can help you understand the problem from this image of a coin tossing experiment in statistics (Step 1). The question is as follows - If we flip two coins independently three times each time with equal probability p/q = 0.5 then find P(X=2) and explain why it's correct:

\textbf{Question} : Flip the first coin twice, thirdly for a total of 3 flips (independent trials). What is the possible number of ways we can get exactly two heads in these three attempts? [Type your answer here]
