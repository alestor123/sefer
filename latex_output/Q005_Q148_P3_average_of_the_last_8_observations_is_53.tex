Sure, I can help you understand the question from this image in a more detailed way using Python's PIL (Pillow) library for handling images which is used here to extract text information of an equation or problem statement related with statistics/mathematics concepts such as mean and variance. 

\textbf{Question} : Let X be the population from where we sample a random subset S consisting of n elements, each element in this set has been chosen independently at random (with replacement). Find:  $$ \text{Var}(S) $$ using $n$ is approximately equal to ?? .  [Hint - Use Python's PIL library for image processing]
