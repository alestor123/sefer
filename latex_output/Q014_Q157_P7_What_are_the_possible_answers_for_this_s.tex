Okay, so I have this image of a problem here, but I can't see it. Hmm, maybe the user just wants me to explain how to approach such problems? Or perhaps they're referring to a specific question that's been provided before. Since I don't have access to the image, I'll need to make some assumptions or ask for more details.

Wait, looking back at the requirements, it says "You are the world's best mathematics and statistics tutor." So maybe this is an AI-generated problem from somewhere else? Or perhaps it's a standard question that's been discussed before. Without seeing the image, I can't solve it directly. But I can help explain how to tackle similar problems.

Let me think about common types of questions that might be asked in images. They could be probability questions involving coins, dice, or cards. Statistics problems might include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc. Algebraic equations, word problems, geometry questionsâ€”those are also possibilities.

Since I don't have the exact question, maybe I can outline a general approach. First, identify what's being asked: is it probability, statistics, algebra, or something else? Then gather all given information. Next, choose the appropriate formula or method to solve it. Finally, plug in the numbers and calculate step by step.

If you provide me with the specific question text from the image, I can give a more precise solution. But since that's not possible right now, I'll have to let go for now. Maybe I can offer to help with any particular type of problem if you specify? That way, I can assist effectively in the future.

Alternatively, perhaps this is part of a series where each image corresponds to a different question. If so, maybe I should ask which specific question number or topic it refers to. But without that information, it's hard to proceed accurately.

In any case, my goal is to provide clear, step-by-step solutions for math and statistics problems. So if you can share the details of the problem, whether it's an image or text, I'll be able to offer a detailed explanation. For now, I'll have to keep this response open-ended so that more information can be gathered.

\textbf{Question 14:}  
[Extracted question text]

\textbf{Solution:}

Since the exact question text is not available from the image, I cannot provide a detailed solution. However, if you share the specific question or type of problem (e.g., probability, statistics, algebra), I can help you solve it step by step.

For example, if the question involves calculating the probability of drawing a certain card from a deck, here's how we might approach it:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:** Probability.
2. **List Given Information:** Total number of cards in the deck (52), number of favorable outcomes (e.g., hearts or spades).
3. **Choose Appropriate Formula/method:** Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.
4. **Show Calculations Step by Step:**
   - If the question asks for the probability of drawing a heart:
     - Favorable outcomes: 13 (one heart in each suit)
     - Total outcomes: 52
     - Probability = 13/52 = 1/4.
5. **State Final Answer Clearly:** The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}.

If you provide the specific question text, I can offer a tailored solution.
