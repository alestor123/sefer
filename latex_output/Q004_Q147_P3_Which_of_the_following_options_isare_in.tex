Sure, I can help you understand the problem from this image of a graph that represents two sets A = {10,25} & B={36}. The question is to find their union U which includes all elements in both set A AND SET B and also exclude any common element. 

\textbf{Question:} Find Union $U$: Given the following data points (A = $\{10,25\}$ âˆª  $B = \{36 \}$). The question is to find U which includes all elements in both sets A AND SET B and also exclude any common element. 

\textbf{Solution:} To solve this problem we can use the union operation: $U=A \cup B = $\{10,25,36\} . This will give us a set that contains every number from each of our original sets (excluding duplicates). The common elements are excluded because they exist in both A and B.
